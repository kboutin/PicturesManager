# PicturesManager

- This project aims at *finding* and *removing* duplicated pictures files.
- It also has a convenient panel to see pictures metadata.

- Dev is currently ongoing, and this software could *NOT* be responsible for any disaster that would occur on your system in any case.

- Would you need more explanations, do not hesitate to drop me an email at : boutinDOTkevATgmailDOTcom.
